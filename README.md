# Hi, I'm Jannes Schreiner! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a 25-year-old **Data and Information Science** student at **Technische Hochschule KÃ¶ln**. My passion lies in the fields of **Python**, **Machine Learning**, and **Data Visualization**. As a future **Data Scientist**, Iâ€™m working towards mastering the art of transforming raw data into valuable insights.

When I'm not studying or working as a **Werkstudent**, I'm exploring ways to bring structure and clarity to complex problems, drawing from my personal experiences with **ADHD** and **autism**. I believe in the power of data to drive positive change and am always looking for new challenges and opportunities to learn.

## What Iâ€™m Working On ðŸ”¨
- Building **data-driven** projects that solve real-world problems
- Enhancing my skills in **Python**, **machine learning**, and **data visualization**
- Expanding my knowledge of **data science methodologies**
