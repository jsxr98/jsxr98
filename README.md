# Hey there, I'm **Jannes Schreiner**! 👋🚀

> _"Turning data into insight is my superpower!"_ 💡

I'm a 25-year-old **Data and Information Science** student at **[Technische Hochschule Köln](https://www.th-koeln.de/)**, with a passion for **Python**, **Machine Learning**, and **Data Visualization**. My goal? To become a cutting-edge **Data Scientist** who shapes the future with data-driven solutions.



## 🚧 **Current Projects** 
🔍 **[My Personal Data Science Playground](https://github.com/jannes-schreiner/ds-playground)**  
_A collection of experimental data science projects, showcasing everything from exploratory data analysis to machine learning models._

🌍 **[Global Climate Insights](https://github.com/jannes-schreiner/climate-insights)**

## 💼 **Werkstudent & University Life**
Balancing work and study life isn't always easy, but I thrive under pressure. Currently, I’m a **Werkstudent**, honing my professional skills while working towards my degree. What drives me is not just solving technical problems, but making sense of chaos, finding patterns where others see randomness.



## 🧠 **Neurodivergence is My Edge**  
Living with **ADHD** and **autism** has taught me to **embrace complexity** and approach problems with a unique perspective. This helps me bring structure and clarity to my work, turning challenges into opportunities for innovation.
